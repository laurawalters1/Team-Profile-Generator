# Team-Profile-Generator

This project is a team profile generator that allows the user to input the details of their team members, and then have this information rendered in a html file that will display it in an easy to read format when viewed in the browser. The user can choose how many team members to add in, and choose from the roles of either "Engineer" or "Intern". Based on the user choice, they will then need to respond to prompts with information about the employee. When the user has finished building their team, they can exit the prompt chain, and at this point their html file will be generated in the dist folder.

## How to use:

The application should be started by opening up the index.js file in the integrated terminal, running the command "npm i" to install the dependencies, and then running the command "node index". Then the user should respond to the prompts that display in the terminal with the required information. When the user has responded to all the prompts and does not wish to add any more employees, they can choose the option "finish building my team", which will end the prompt chain and cause the index.html file to be generated. The user should then find their team profile html file in the dist folder.

## Example Profile

Below is a screenshot of of a team profile that was generated using this application. The files for this example have been included in the example folder. The href for the css has been amended post generation to account for the change in file name to "example.css".
